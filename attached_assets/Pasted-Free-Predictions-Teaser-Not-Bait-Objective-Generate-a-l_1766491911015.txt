Free Predictions (Teaser, Not Bait)
Objective:
Generate a limited set of free predictions that demonstrate real value and edge, while clearly differentiating from paid access in depth, volume and tooling.
1. Purpose of Free Predictions
Free predictions are not marketing hype
They are a sample of system quality
Users should think:
“If this is free… what does paid look like?”
2. Quantity & Frequency
Maximum:
1–3 free picks per day
Never more than:
10–15% of total daily picks
This ensures:
Value without saturation
Curiosity without cannibalization
3. Quality Requirements (IMPORTANT)
Free predictions must:
Have positive and solid EV
Be selected from:
Strong or High EV tier only
Never be “leftovers” or low-quality picks
EV Guidelines (example):
Minimum EV: +6%
Preferably +8%+
Odds range:
Typically 1.80 – 3.50
Avoid extreme longshots for free tier
4. What Free Predictions SHOW
Free users should see:
Match & market
Odds (BEST + 2ND)
EV badge (color-coded)
Short expandable:
“Why this pick” (max 2 bullets)
Example bullets:
📊 Model probability vs market implied
💰 Best odds above fair price
This shows analysis exists, without giving everything away.
5. What Free Predictions DO NOT SHOW
Free users should NOT see:
Full odds shopping (all bookmakers)
Kelly / bankroll tools
Advanced filters
Historical performance per market
CLV data
Those remain Premium / Premium Pro only.
6. Positioning Copy (Important)
Each free pick should include subtle copy such as:
“This is a sample prediction from PGR Sports Analytics.
Full access includes more picks, advanced tools and market comparison.”
No hype. No CTA spam.
7. Legal & Ethical Safeguards
Clearly mark:
“Informational purposes only”
“No betting advice”
Free predictions follow the same disclaimer as paid picks.
No guarantees, no suggested stake.
8. Consistency Rule
Free predictions must follow the exact same model logic as paid picks.
No manual selection.
No cherry-picking after results.
This protects:
credibility
trust
long-term brand value
9. Key Principle
Free = quality preview
Paid = control, depth, volume
